  <u>5 steps for successful A/B Testing</u>
</h3>
<ol type = "1">
<li>Determine test variable: What tactic are you testing? Examples: Call to action, ad imagery, targeting, landing page</li><br>
<li>Identify test KPI: What is the primary metric that will determine the winning tactic? Examples: CTR, CPSV, ROAS</li><br>
<li>Define test and control groups. Control group reflects the standard/usual tactic used.
   Test group reflects the altered tactic that you want to compare to your standard approach.
    Remember that the test variable is the only difference between both groups.
     All other variables such as budget, frequency, creative and duration must be kept the same.</li><br>
  <li>Split your sample groups equally and randomly. There must be no overlap in users between the sample groups.
     Most platforms offer A/B tools that automatically create randomized delivery groups. </li><br>
     <li>Determine sample size. Use Budget Calculator to determine minimum sample size and budget.</li><br>

<h3>
Base Conversion Rate:
</h3>
<p>The number of conversions (i.e. test KPI) divided by the total number of impressions. Depending on the test KPI, this could be clicks/visits/sales.
  Look at historical data to get a base conversion rate that you expect the Control group to perform at.
  </p>
<i>
  Example: Lets say your test KPI is Clicks, and you want to test if one campaign is better than another.<br> 
  Using historical data we can see that we usually get 20,000 impressions and 300 clicks.<br>
  Now we can caluclate the base conversion rate to be:<br>
  <center>
  <div class="frac">
  <span>Clicks</span>
  <span class="symbol">/</span>
  <span class="bottom">Impressions</span>
</div> = 
<div class="frac">
  <span>300</span>
  <span class="symbol">/</span>
  <span class="bottom">20,000</span>
</div> = 0.015 = 1.5%
  </center>
</i>
<hr style="clear:both">
<h3>
CPM:
</h3>
<p>Cost per mille (1,000 impressions).</p>
<i>Example: If we get 12,000 impressions after spending 231 $, then the CPM can be calculated as: <br><br>
  <center>
  <div class="frac">
    <span>Cost</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class = bottom> Impressions</span>
  </div> <span>&#215;</span> 1,000 = 
  <div class="frac">
    <span>231 $</span>
    <span class="symbol">/</span>
    <span class = bottom> 12,000</span>
  </div> <span>&#215;</span> 1,000 = 19.25 $
  </center>
</i>
<hr style="clear:both">
<h3>
  Frequency:
</h3>
<p>The frequency of which you target consumers</p>
<i>Example: If you have 20,000 impressions split out on 13,000 unique consumers then your frequency will be: <br><br>
  <center>
    <div class="frac">
      <span>Impressions</span>
      <span class="symbol">/</span>
      <span class="bottom">consumers</span>
    </div> = 
    <div class="frac">
      <span>20,000</span>
      <span class="symbol">/</span>
      <span class="bottom">13,000</span>
    </div> = 1.54
  </center>
